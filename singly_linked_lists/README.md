Singly Linked Lists in C
This project covers the basics of linked lists in the C programming language. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing data and a pointer to the next node in the list. Linked lists are useful for dynamic memory allocation, as the size of the list can grow or shrink as needed.

The project consists of four exercises:

Print List: This function takes a pointer to the head of a linked list and prints all the elements of the list. The function returns the number of nodes in the list.

List Length: This function takes a pointer to the head of a linked list and returns the number of elements in the list.

Add Node: This function takes a pointer to the head of a linked list and a string, and adds a new node to the beginning of the list containing the string. The function returns the address of the new node.

Add Node End: This function takes a pointer to the head of a linked list and a string, and adds a new node to the end of the list containing the string. The function returns the address of the new node.

Free List: This function takes a pointer to the head of a linked list and frees all the nodes in the list.

Each exercise is tested with a main function and a set of tests to ensure that the code works as expected. The code is written in accordance with the Betty coding style and should be easy to understand and follow.

To use the code, simply compile the main file and the implementation file for each exercise and run the resulting executable. The code has been tested and should work as expected on most systems.
