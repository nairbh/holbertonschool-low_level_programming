# Binary Project

## Description

This project is about converting binary numbers to unsigned integers, printing binary representations of numbers, and manipulating bits in C. The goal is to understand how binary numbers work and how to manipulate them.

## Files

The project consists of several files:

- `main.h`: header file containing the prototypes of the functions used in the project.
- `binary_to_uint.c`: function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- `print_binary.c`: function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- `get_bit.c`: function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- `set_bit.c`: function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- `clear_bit.c`: function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- `flip_bits.c`: function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

## How to Compile

To compile the code, use the following command:

gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 file.c main_file.c -o executable


## Example

Here is an example of the output of the program:

./executable
1
